// Multi-backend execution.
//
// trellis historically ran every graph with ggml_backend_graph_compute() on a single
// backend, which requires that backend to support *every* op in the graph. That holds for
// CUDA and Vulkan, whose op coverage is near-complete. It does not hold for the Qualcomm
// Hexagon NPU: the HTP skel implements a subset of ops and rejects tensors larger than
// VTCM, and with no scheduler those ops are simply never executed -- the run reports
// "dsp-rsp: UNKNOWN" and continues with undefined data until the DSP queue desynchronizes.
//
// ggml_backend_sched assigns each node to a backend that actually supports it, keeping
// weight-consuming ops on the backend that owns the weights and inserting copies where a
// node has to run elsewhere. That is what makes partial-coverage accelerators usable.

//        0 off (legacy single-backend path), 1 on.
